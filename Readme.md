Simple File Uploader

The simple file loader application enables you to upload files to the server using ajax with progress.

You can choose any file of choice from the systems file chooser,
you can preview the file for image files only, no preview currently available for non-image files. 
you can upload the file and watch the progress while also having the option of cancelling the upload.
If network fails, you can try again and attempt to reconnect in order to continue upload.
You can always resume file upload from last failed attempt if the file has not been modified and are in the same browser session.

The application was implemented in the html and javascript with not external or additional library.
